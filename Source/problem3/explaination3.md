My memo describle:
I use merge sort to sort list from ascending (Actually descending is better)
So I create 2 number
I think greater number will start with max number
And If i want to get the second big number I need to start with max number - 1 index

Complexity: Olog(n), because 0->9 is constant 10 is over small for O(n) so complexity still Olog(n)
