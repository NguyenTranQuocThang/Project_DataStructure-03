I follow your suggestion but i change it( a little)

I will explain some special

split_path:
to avoid '/' syntax I filter them with element is not empty
so when u search /abc/ -> i just get 'abc' not get '' ,'abc',''

Another code i follow your comment description in method
It is't quite to understand

Time complex: O(log(n))
Space complex:O(1)

Base(Binary tree, dictionary)
