This problem just require to find a square number for an integer so I just make it the simplest

1. I start at i = 0 because we can find square numbers for a negative integer

2. I compare i x i with number argument, if equal -> return i

3. if i x i greater than number -> if we increase 1 we just get i x i greater than before -> return -1

4. I will increase i with one

Complex: Olog(n) -> n is number , I think went i put larget number -> number comparation corresponding will be execute
